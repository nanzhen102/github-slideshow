# 1. Coursera course-Finding Hidden Messages in DNA \(Bioinformatics I\)

start from Nov. 5th, 2020

### Week1

#### **1.1** the Honors Track

it includes Code Challenges and Charging Station.

For best results, you should try solving a Code Challenge _before_ proceeding to a Charging Station in this course.

#### **1.2** the Bioinformatics Specialization

#### 1.3 **Genome Replication**

a cell replicates its genome, then it divides.

Replication begins in a genomic region called the **replication origin** \(denoted _**ori**_\)  and is carried out by molecular copy machines called **DNA polymerases**.

the region of the bacterial genome encoding _ori_ is typically a few hundred nucleotides long

> "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense except in the Light of Evolution"

> -- Theodosius Dobzhansky

the initiation of replication is mediated by _**DnaA**_, a protein that binds to a short segment within the _ori_ known as a _**DnaA**_ **box**. 

#### 1.4 Code Challenge

```python
def occurences(string, substring):
	count = start =0 
	while True:
		start = text.find(substring, start) + 1 
		if start > 0:
			count += 1
		else:
			return count

# python, find() functionÂ 

print(occurences(string, substring))
```
