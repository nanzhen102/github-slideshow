# 2. Coursera course-Finding Hidden Messages in DNA \(Bioinformatics I\)

start from Nov. 5th, 2020

### Week1

#### **1.1** the Honors Track

it includes Code Challenges and Charging Station.

For best results, you should try solving a Code Challenge _before_ proceeding to a Charging Station in this course.

#### **1.2** the Bioinformatics Specialization

#### 1.3 **Genome Replication**

a cell replicates its genome, then it divides.

Replication begins in a genomic region called the **replication origin** \(denoted _**ori**_\)  and is carried out by molecular copy machines called **DNA polymerases**.

the region of the bacterial genome encoding _ori_ is typically a few hundred nucleotides long

> "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense except in the Light of Evolution"

> -- Theodosius Dobzhansky

the initiation of replication is mediated by _**DnaA**_, a protein that binds to a short segment within the _ori_ known as a _**DnaA**_ **box**. 

#### 1.4 Code Challenge

```python
def occurences(string, substring):
	count = start =0 
	while True:
		start = text.find(substring, start) + 1 
		if start > 0:
			count += 1
		else:
			return count

# python, find() function 

print(occurences(string, substring))
```

```python
def FrequencyMap(text,k): # 定义两个变量
	freq = {} # 新建一个字典
	n = len(text) #新建一个局部变量，统计长度
	for i in range(n-k+1):
		pattern = text[i:i+k]
		if pattern in freq:
			freq[pattern] += 1
		else:
			freq[pattern] = 1
	return freq
print(FrequencyMap(text,k))

def FrequentKmers(text,k):
	kmers = []
	freq = FrequencyMap(text,k)
	m = max(freq.values())
	for most_frequent_kmer in freq:
		if freq[most_frequent_kmer] == m:
			kmers.append(most_frequent_kmer)
	return kmers
print("most frequent 4-mers is")
print(FrequentKmers(text,k))
```
