# 4.2 shell script

```text
- If you find you need to use arrays for anything more than assignment of ${PIPESTATUS}, you should use Python.
- If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, you should probably be writing it in Python instead. Bear in mind that scripts grow. Rewrite your script in another language early to avoid a time-consuming rewrite at a later date.
